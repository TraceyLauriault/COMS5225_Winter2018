# Course Description
> The emphasis of this class is to learn to envision data genealogically, as assemblages, as part of a dispositif and infrastructure in order to reframe them beyond technological conceptions. Emphasis will be on the sociotechnical, political and philosophical aspects of data. During the term we will explore data, facts and truth; the power of data both big and small; governmentality and biopolitics; risk, probability and the taming of chance; algorithmic culture, dynamic nominalism, categorization and ontologies; and the circularity of the transduction and translation of people, space and social phenomena into and by data and software and finally we will discuss the role of data in the production of knowledge.

> The class will be led like a workshop, and we will both discuss and apply theory. The theme for this term will be dashboards and control rooms with the City of Ottawa Paramedic Communication Centre (Despatch) as the case study.

### Reading Reportage (25%):

A paper reportage schedule will be made during the Week 1 class in collaboration with students. The students will lead a 1 hour seminar based on the assigned readings.  This will include a 40-45 minute lecture and the facilitation of a 15-20 minute for Q & A session. Students are encouraged to augment the reading with related real world examples based on real world data. 

### Data Description and Conceptualization- Due Week 2 11:55 Jan. 17 (10%):

Select a dataset directly related to a topic or a subject you might engage with or are currently engaged with in your graduate work or a dataset in the wild. 

In a total of 3 pages describe them technically and in such a way that 10 years from now you will be able to decipher the nature of these data. Technical descriptions of data generally include the following, but do not be limited to this: consider format, sample size, headings, metadata, include licences and terms of use, how are they disseminated, the producing institution, data authors if there are any, who created them, dates, geography, classifications, models, methods, and etc. Be sure to cite the dataset & provide the URL, be sure to cite any other documentation related to this dataset, you can use footnotes if you like, but use full citation. Get to know these data and familiarize yourself with them.

You will also conceptually frame these data by applying at least 2 of Kitchin's conceptualizations beyond the technical and see if you can identify any elements of the socio-technological assemblage. 
You might also want to say a little something about your interest in this dataset, what you might use the data for, how the data are conventionally used and explain what led you to trust these data. 
You are welcome to use screen-captures and they will not go against your page count.

Think of this as a critically informed lab report.

### Poster Project (8 parts):

Students will demonstrate their familiarity with the course material by applying critical data studies concepts and theories in relation to the data studied during the Paramedic Communication Centre field trip. This can be a specific dataset, database, algorithm, data infrastructure, data system, control room, dashboard, standards and etc. of their choice and this will be communicated in a poster format and presented at Data Day 5.0 on March 27 organized by the Institute for Data Science. 

#### 3.1 Field Trip to the Paramedic Communication Centre Week 3 Jan. 26. (5%)
Logistic details to follow.

#### 3.2 Paramedic Control Room Data Assemblage Brains Storm, Week 4, Feb. 2 (5%)
Students can use Mindmap, Coggle.it, or power point or any other tool to draw out/illustrate anything they like related to the socio-technological assemblage of the data or data system encountered at the Paramedic Communication Centre. Students will submit this to CULearn and will discuss their ideas for 5 minutes each in class. We will then allocate time to discuss these ideas as a group in class.

#### 3.3 Poster Project Proposal, Week 5 Feb.9, (5%), 1 page Quad Chart:
1.	Introduce the dataset, database, indicator, data infrastructure, data standard you will discuss in your poster.
2.	Provide two potential research questions.
3.	State which theory, philosophy and concepts you plan to engage with & why.
4.	References.

#### 3.4 DRAFT Poster Project Abstract for peer review Week 6 Feb. 16 (5%):
See CUIDS instructions. 

#### 3.5 Submit Final Poster Abstract Week 7, Mar. 2 (5%)

#### 3.6 Digital Draft of Poster for In-Class Peer Review Week 9 Mar. 16, in class (5%)
See CUIDS instructions. Note that a poster as a form of scholarly communication is common in scientific fields, geomatics and engineering. The following are some general instructions to guide the production of your posters but keep in mind that your poster will be somewhat different and you will have to adapt these techniques to critical data studies and your topic. Also, note this is not an infographic, this is a ‘scientific’ poster.  Here are some useful guidelines:
* [NYU Libraries Guide](http://guides.nyu.edu/c.php?g=276826&p=1846154)
* [Urbana Champaign Library Guide](http://guides.library.illinois.edu/c.php?g=347412&p=2343433)
* [10 Simple Rules for a Good Poster Presentation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1876493/) 

#### 3.7 Print poster and submit digital copy to CULearn Week 10 of Mar. 20, 20%
If your poster is accepted for Data Day 4.0 a print out of your poster will be required and generally there is a cost to this (+/-40$). Should your poster not be accepted a digital copy only is to be submitted. Whether or not your poster is accepted does not affect your mark.  

#### 3.8 Attend Data day 5.0 Poster Session Mar. 27.

### 4.	Paramedic Dashboard Feedback report Week 11 Apr. 6 (10%)

### Late Policy:
Extensions must be requested in advance, in person, and will typically require documentation of an extended illness or other significant disruption to your ability to complete the required work.

# Week 8 (Mar. 9) – Mapping
This class will take place in the library where we examine large technological systems and the materiality of infrastructure by studying the curated map, atlas and document display entitled the the Evolution of the Canadian Communication Infrastructure You will learn to read communication technology maps, identify patterns, indicators, the geography of communication, and consider policy, politics, business and economics as these pertain to communication and nation building.

#### In-Class Map Assignment 10%. 
> In the Map, Data and Government Information Centre there is a map display entitled the Evolution of the Communication Infrastructure in Canada. The maps are organized into groups and will be assigned a set of maps and an in-class assignment will be handed to you.  You will be required to consider the Harley Paper for this assignment. These maps and books are irreplaceable please treat them with care.

> You will see a number of manuscripts from the Canada Year Books (1861-2011) as well as three Commissions (1929, 1949-51 & 1957) in the Library. Six of the Year Books include a special history of communications in Canada (1932, 1933, 1947, 1957-58, 1959 and 1967). You are welcome to refer to these for your in-class assignment.

## Week 12 (Apr. 11) – Assemblages, Genealogies and Dynamic Nominalism
No readings are assigned for this week. In-class we will examine three methodological approaches that can be applied to the study of data big and small. Examples will be drawn from the professor’s first-hand experience in three cities and three different case studies. In addition we will review the theories discussed throughout the term.
